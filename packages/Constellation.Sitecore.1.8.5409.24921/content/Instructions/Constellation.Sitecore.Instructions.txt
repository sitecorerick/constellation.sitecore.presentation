Instructions
============
There are a number of interesting components in this library. They are discussed individually here.

IContextSensitive and ContextValidator
--------------------------------------
Useful for Rules, Pipelines and Event Handlers. IContextSensitive defines a series of properties that
are used by ContextValidator to determine if a given piece of code should run. HttpPipeline processors
are a classic example, where you might want them to run against your websites but not against the Sitecore
Client.

Have your handler inherit from IContextSensitive, and ensure that before your processing method executes
anything, it uses ContextValidator to determine if the code should execute.

Examples: 

* Pipelines.HttpRequestProcessor (which is a base class you can use)
* Rules.Actions.RuleAction (which is a base class you can use)

DatasourceResolver
------------------
Provides a quick way to make sure your XPath query or fast-query statements are escaped properly.

ItemExtensions and LanguageExtensions
-------------------------------------
Critical multi-site and multi-language capabilities to make sure your front-end code has the right
item in the right language every time.

SiteInfoExtensions
------------------
Adds support for an additional site definition parameter that allows a developer to specify *all* 
the languages a given site should support.

Rules
-----
A number of rule actions to move items around on save:
* MoveToAlphabeticalFolder - based on Item.Name. There are lots of overridable paramters
* MoveToDateFolder - based on the date field of your choosing. There are lots of overridable paramters
